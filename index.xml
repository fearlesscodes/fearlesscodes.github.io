      <description>In this post I want to talk about how I encountered a situation where I applied an aspect of Test Driven Development and Clean Code. It lets you write and refactor your code without any fear of breaking it and analyze and philosophise about the usability of functions or components.
This post is about creating a component in Angular which should receive a list of x,y-points which will be displayed as a svg polyline html element.</description>

I am Anton and a full-stack developer with currently these technologies:
 Angular Java (Spring) Gitlab Docker Kubernetes  I began with Angular and Java at my first job and at the end of my first job I gained more knowledge about packaging and deploying the applications with Gitlab, Docker and Kubernetes.
